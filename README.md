# Phys-219
*** Made for a school project. Worked locally, then uploaded to GitHub. This is why there are only 3 commits. ***

This is a lab where my partner and I built a radio which could be used to tune in real radio stations.

Some of the code for testing was provided, we would just change the parameters according to our needs.
